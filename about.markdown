# About Calyxium

**Calyxium** is a modern, statically-typed programming language designed for efficiency, readability, and flexibility.  
It comes with a custom virtual machine, a simple syntax inspired by functional and imperative languages, and a growing standard library.

## Goals

- **Performance**: Compiled to a lightweight bytecode executed on our custom VM.
- **Simplicity**: Minimal syntax, clear semantics, and predictable behavior.
- **Expressiveness**: Supports higher-order functions, strong typing, and pattern matching.
- **Community-driven**: Designed to evolve with contributions from users and developers.
